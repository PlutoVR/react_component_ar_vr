# react_component_ar_vr
An example of React Component rendered using Aardvark for VR games, with synchronized data driven by events using croquet as a backend.

Work in progress, still stumbling around a bit finding out how to play nice with react / aardvark

## NOTES:

- The dance with grabbable vs transform is a workaround for the moment.
- The repeated elements cause aardvark to crash when multiple people are interacting with them, investigating.
